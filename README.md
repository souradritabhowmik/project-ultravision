# project-ultravision
ultravision: a minimalist web app for creating an online vision board — a place to visualize your dream life, motivations, and what you’re working towards.

## ✨ features

- Upload or paste image URLs (e.g. from Pinterest) to form your personal board
- Each board displays up to **8 images** in a simple grid
- Auto-generates a unique **bookmarkable URL** so you can revisit your board anytime
- Aesthetic **light lilac / pastel lavender** theme with a **pixel videogame-style font**
- Built with **Flask (Python)** — frontend uses inline HTML + CSS
- No database needed — images are stored in the `/boards/` folder on the server
